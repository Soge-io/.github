# Team

Table of Content
Github added this feature already so you don't need to do it. So, Just use headings (#), subheadings(#), or h1,h2 tags and it will automatically have at the top left corner of your README.md file.

Links
Use markdown link as [Link Text](link) of your live project, repo, API, API repo. I am sure you are wondering why you should put repo here but your project is not always be seen on GitHub people also clone it on their system and this file also gets cloned so you must put this link there. So, anyone can visit back the repo.

Include screenshots
You can use Images to show your project, how it looks while running. For putting screenshots you can either drag and drop images or use the image in markdown as ![Image Name](Image location)

How to use your software
The most important part after the description is this, You need to provide instruction on how to install your program and how to run it. Make it comprehensive as much as possible So, even a beginner can use it.
